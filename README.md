A scenario-based ‘game’ to help start open conversations about race, unpack differences in opinion, and help us navigate the grey zones of what we should or should not accept as a society

## Results

## Tech
The frontend was written entirely in vanillla Javascript without a framework. The swipable cards were taken from https://codepen.io/bmarcelino/pen/vRYPXV and the typewriter animation from https://codepen.io/daviddcarr/pen/XVyQMM

There isn't a backend or a server. The frontend will make a direct API call to Google Forms to submit the data, and the form will populate the Google Sheet, which does aggregations. Another API call is made to retrieve the aggregate data from Google Sheet.
